# xamarin-architecture

This is the start of a Xamarin Onion Architecture sample project including both Android and iOS Presentation projects.

Before you can debug the iOS project, you must connect Visual Studio to a Mac build host, and generate valid keys from the Apple Developer Center.

The iOS project is not using any shared code currently. Pull requests to update are welcome.
